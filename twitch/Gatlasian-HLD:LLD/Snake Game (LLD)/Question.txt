🐍 Snake Game Design Problem 🕹️

Design a system for a classic snake game where the following rules apply:

- 🐍 The snake can move in a specified direction (up, down, left, right).
- 🍎 When the snake eats the food, it grows in length.
- 🔁 The game ends when the snake crosses or collides with itself.
- 🍴 Food is generated at regular intervals in random positions on the grid.

Your task:
- Design the data structures needed to represent the snake, food, and game board.
- Implement the movement of the snake and ensure it correctly grows when food is eaten.
- Detect when the snake crosses itself and trigger a game over.
- Ensure that food is randomly placed and generated after specific intervals.

How would you design and implement this game system? What edge cases would you consider?
