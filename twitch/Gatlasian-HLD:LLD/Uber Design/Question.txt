🧠 Problem Statement:

You are tasked with designing the backend system for a Ride-Hailing Service (similar to Uber) 🚖,
where users can book rides 🚗, drivers can accept or reject rides, and the system manages the entire flow from ride booking to payment.
The focus is on designing the core functionalities like ride matching, driver and rider location updates,
and trip management 🛣️, while ensuring the system can scale to handle a large number of riders and drivers globally 🌍.

💡 Requirements:

🔍 Functional Requirements:

1. User Actions:
   - Riders: Can request rides 🚖 by setting a pickup and drop-off location 📍.
   - Drivers: Can accept or reject rides 📲.
   - Ride Matching: The system should match riders with available nearby drivers 📍 based on factors like distance, driver rating, and ETA 🕒.
   - Trip Management: Riders and drivers can view the trip status 🔄, update their location in real time 🗺️,
     and receive live notifications 📳 (e.g., "Driver has arrived").

2. Payment & Invoicing:
   - Riders can pay for their trips digitally 💳, and an invoice/receipt 🧾 is generated after the ride.

3. Ride History & Ratings:
   - Both riders and drivers can view their ride history 📚 and provide ratings ⭐ and feedback after a trip 📝.

⚙️ Non-Functional Requirements:

1. Scalability:
   - The system should support millions of active users globally 🌍, managing ride requests and driver location updates in real time ⏱️.

2. Availability:
   - Ensure high availability ⏳ with minimal downtime, even under heavy traffic 🚦.

3. Low Latency:
   - Ride matching and location updates should be processed with minimal delay 🏃‍♂️.

4. Security:
   - Ensure secure transactions 🔒 and protect personal information of riders and drivers 🛡️.

🌐 API Design:

Design the RESTful APIs 🌍 to manage riders, drivers, rides, and payments 💳. The APIs should support:

- User Authentication: For both riders and drivers 🔑, including login, registration, and verification.
- Ride Management: APIs to request rides 📝, update ride status 🔄, and handle trip details 🛣️.
- Location Updates: Real-time API for sharing rider/driver location 📍 and updating trip status.
- Payment Processing: APIs for managing digital payments 💳 and generating receipts.

🗃️ Database Design:

Create a schema to handle the following entities:

1. Users (Riders & Drivers): Store personal details 🧑‍💻, location data 📍, and account status.
2. Rides: Store ride details 🛣️, including pickup/drop-off locations 📍, fare 💵, and trip status.
3. Vehicles: Track each driver's vehicle details 🚗, including license plate and car model.
4. Payments: Store payment transactions 💳 and link them to completed trips 🧾.
5. Ratings & Feedback: Track rider and driver ratings ⭐ and feedback for trip quality improvement 📊.

🔍 Use Case Queries:

Write SQL queries 🧑‍💻 to solve the following:

1. Retrieve all rides taken by a specific rider within the last month 📅.
2. Fetch all available drivers within a 5km radius of a rider's pickup location 🗺️.
3. Generate a report 📊 showing the average rating for all drivers in a particular city 🏙️.



This format keeps the question clear, focused on functionality, while ensuring it includes the necessary LLD details.
