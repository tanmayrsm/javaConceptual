Design trending videos on Youtube.
This was by far my favourite round and the interviewer seemed a great person
and we had a nice discussion starting from the services involved, the API request response structures,
the choice of database, the DB schema. My approach was to design a ingestion pipeline to stream video
view count telemetry which would then be used to build a hit counter kind of system.
This would then go into a ranking engine with weighted ranking algorithm based on various metrics &
finally each video would be assigned a %ile score determining their position in the "trend".
We discussed on various aspects like DB sharding, pagination, how the services would scale,
various LB algorithms like round robin, weighted round robin, etc.I really enjoyed giving this round.

I would rate myself a 8/10 in this round.
(I am mostly a backend engineer so I called out upfront I will not be able to cover
the ML side of things in the ranking,he said that's completely fine since this is a SDE role and his
primary expectation was the system architecture & the scaling aspects)
