Second round - LLD
Typical Rate Limiter question. Asked me to code "X requests in Y seconds" and how would i make it extendable.
First off, interviewer was rudee - came late, no introduction whatsoever,
assumed the interviewee is familiar with various rate limiting algorithms.
Anyway, implemented fixed time window algorithm
(after choosing between token bucket or sliding time window) with appropriate interfaces.


2nd Round: LLD


The usual famous rate limiter question.
I first implemented using a sliding counter based approach but interviewer was not satisfied
with the approach for some reason. I was around 30 minutes into the interview.
To me the algorithm seemed fine, and when I asked him to give some examples where
it would not work he was unable to give but asked me to try some other approach,
instead of arguing with him, I decided to use the remaining time in coming up with the
conventional queue based sliding window approach. He was satisfied with this solution.
After this, in the remaining 5 minutes he briefly asked some follow up questions on real
life implementations of rate limiters and how they could be designed.
In my company we have rule engine configuration based rate limiters so told him about the architecture of the same.


I would rate myself a 8/10 in this round.
