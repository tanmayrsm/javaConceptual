1. Clarify the Problem (5 minutes):
- Start by clarifying the scope of the question:
- Are we integrating with existing JIRA and Confluence systems or building the tag management from scratch?
- Should we assume that the user base is already set in JIRA/Confluence?
- How important is performance under scale, and what does "thousands of tags" specifically mean (hundreds of thousands of associations)?
- Confirm that notifications should go through existing platforms (JIRA/Confluence), or should we introduce custom notifications?
- Ask any necessary clarifications about edge cases:
- What should happen when a tag is deactivated but is already associated with issues/pages?

2. Outline the Approach (5-10 minutes):
- User Roles & Permissions:
- Start with the user roles: Admins, Developers, and Content Creators.
- How different permissions will map to actions like creating tags, applying tags, and deactivating tags.
- Tag Lifecycle & Tagging Rules:
- Discuss how tags transition from "Active" to "Inactive."
- Briefly mention the multi-select tagging feature and the potential for parent-child relationships (hierarchical tags).
- Search & Filtering:
- Explain how users will search for and filter tags using metadata such as category, usage frequency, or hierarchy.
- Notifications:
- Describe how users will be notified (push, email, or in-app notifications) when tags are modified or removed.

3. API Design (10-15 minutes):
- User Authentication & Role Management:
- RESTful APIs for login, registration, and role-based access control.
- Example endpoints:
- `POST /login`
- `GET /roles`
- Tag Management:
- CRUD APIs for creating, updating, deactivating, and deleting tags.
- Example endpoints:
- `POST /tags`: Create new tags (Admins only).
- `PUT /tags/{id}`: Update tags.
- `DELETE /tags/{id}`: Deactivate tags.
- Tag Association:
- APIs to link tags to JIRA issues or Confluence pages.
- Example endpoints:
- `POST /tags/associate`: Associate tags with JIRA issues or Confluence pages.
- `GET /tags/{entityId}`: Get tags for a specific issue or page.

4. Database Schema Design (10-15 minutes):
- Entities:
- Users table: `id`, `name`, `email`, `role`
- Tags table: `id`, `name`, `description`, `status`
- Tag Associations table: `tag_id`, `entity_type` (JIRA/Confluence), `entity_id`
- Audit Logs table: `action`, `user_id`, `timestamp`, `tag_id`
- ER Diagram:
- Quickly sketch the relationships between users, tags, tag associations, and audit logs.
- Highlight the one-to-many relationship between tags and JIRA/Confluence entities.

5. Non-Functional Requirements (5-10 minutes):
- Scalability:
- Discuss horizontal scaling strategies, including database sharding for tags and caching frequently queried tags.
- Availability:
- Consider using distributed databases or replication to ensure high availability.
- Ensure failover mechanisms are in place (e.g., for database or API failures).
- Latency:
- Use techniques such as query optimization, caching (Redis, Memcached), and indexing for fast tag search and retrieval.
- Security:
- Emphasize role-based access control, API authentication (JWT, OAuth), and encryption of sensitive data (SSL/TLS).
- Auditability:
- Mention the importance of logging all tag actions (creation, updates, deletions) for traceability.

6. Use Case Queries (5-10 minutes):
- Write SQL queries for the use cases:
1. Retrieve all tags used in a specific JIRA project:
```sql
SELECT t.name FROM tags t
JOIN tag_associations ta ON t.id = ta.tag_id
WHERE ta.entity_type = 'JIRA' AND ta.entity_id = <JIRA_PROJECT_ID>;
```
2. Fetch tags associated with a specific Confluence page:
```sql
SELECT t.name FROM tags t
JOIN tag_associations ta ON t.id = ta.tag_id
WHERE ta.entity_type = 'Confluence' AND ta.entity_id = <PAGE_ID>;
```
3. Generate report of tag usage frequency across projects:
```sql
SELECT t.name, COUNT(ta.tag_id) as usage_count
FROM tags t
JOIN tag_associations ta ON t.id = ta.tag_id
GROUP BY t.name
ORDER BY usage_count DESC;
```

7. Q&A and Edge Cases (Remaining time):
- Discuss how to handle tag conflicts, e.g., if two projects want the same tag name.
- Handle the edge case of searching with large data sets and maintaining hierarchical tag integrity.
