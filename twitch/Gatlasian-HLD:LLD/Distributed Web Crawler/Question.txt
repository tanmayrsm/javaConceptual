🚀 System Design Interview Question: Build a Web Crawler

🕸️ Scenario:
You are tasked with designing a scalable web crawler 🕵️‍♂️ that can efficiently crawl millions of web pages 🌐.
This system will be responsible for gathering structured data 🧩 from websites and handling the complexities of large-scale crawling.
You need to build this system while ensuring it can scale to billions of pages, handle errors 🛑,
avoid loops 🔁, and manage retries when requests fail ❌.

🔍 Requirements:

1. Crawl Multiple Websites Concurrently 🌍:
- The system should crawl millions of pages every day. The crawler must support parallel requests to speed up crawling.

2. URL De-duplication 🚫🔁:
- Prevent duplicate URLs from being crawled more than once, ensuring the same page is not reprocessed.

3. Handle Different Types of Pages 📄:
- The crawler should be able to handle different types of content:
- HTML pages.
- Static resources (images, CSS).
- PDFs or other document formats.

4. Retry Mechanism 🔄:
- Implement a retry mechanism in case of failed requests (e.g., due to network failures 🌐 or server errors 🛑).

5. Respect Robots.txt 🤖:
- The crawler should respect website rules defined in the robots.txt file. Make sure the crawler doesn't breach the rules!

6. URL Depth Limit 📏:
- The crawler must only go up to 3 levels deep from the starting page (for example, homepage > category page > product page).

7. Avoid Loops 🔄❌:
- Detect and avoid loops when visiting web pages (e.g., a link on Page A takes you to Page B, which links back to Page A).

8. Data Storage 🏦:
- Store the data efficiently:
- Metadata about the web pages.
- HTML content.
- URLs crawled.
- Optional: Add support for indexing the data for fast lookup 🔍.

9. Throttling 🐢:
- The system must be polite in its crawling, meaning it should limit the number of requests to a single domain to avoid overloading websites.

10. Scalability 📈:
- Design the system so that it can scale as the number of pages to crawl increases exponentially.
Ensure your design can handle millions of URLs at once.

🚨 Non-Functional Requirements:

- Latency ⏱️:
The system should be designed for low latency so that it can crawl and process pages in a timely manner.

- Fault Tolerance 🔧:
The system must be resilient against failures. What happens if some of the crawlers fail?

- Monitoring & Logging 📊:
The system should log every request made, track the number of successful/failed requests, and monitor real-time performance metrics.

📋 Clarifications You Can Ask During the Interview:

1. Scope of Crawling 🛣️:
- Should the crawler only work on public websites, or will it need to support login-protected sites?

2. Data Processing 📈:
- Do we need to process data (such as extracting specific tags or content) from the pages, or just store raw HTML for now?

3. Crawling Frequency 🔄:
- How often should the pages be re-crawled? Should there be a refresh rate for certain URLs?

4. Robots.txt Compliance 🤖:
- How strict are the rules for respecting robots.txt files? Should there be options for overriding them?

5. Infrastructure 🏗️:
- Should this be built for cloud deployment (AWS, GCP), or is it assumed to be deployed on-premises?

🛠️ Design Components:

1. Crawler Manager 🎛️:
- Manages the pool of crawlers running concurrently. Assigns URLs to be crawled, keeping track of which pages have been visited.

2. URL Frontier 🏃‍♂️:
- A queue that stores URLs to be visited. The crawler picks URLs from this queue, processes them, and stores new URLs that it finds.
- Must handle URL de-duplication to avoid repeated crawling.

3. Parser 📝:
- Extracts relevant data from HTML pages (or other types of files). Processes and stores this information for future use.

4. Data Storage 💾:
- Metadata Database: Stores information about visited pages (timestamp, URL, response status).
- HTML/Content Storage: Stores the actual content of crawled pages.

5. Scheduler & Throttler 🕒:
- Manages request timing, preventing overloading websites or violating their robots.txt rules. Could implement rate-limiting to slow down requests.

6. Retry System 🔄:
- Implements retries with backoff for failed requests. For example, if a page fails, retry it after a few seconds.

7. Robots.txt Handler 🤖:
- Fetches and processes robots.txt files from websites, ensuring the crawler respects disallowed paths and throttling instructions.

8. Loop Detection 🔄🛑:
- Identifies URL patterns that cause loops (A -> B -> A) and avoids re-crawling such URLs.

9. Scaling Mechanism 📈:
- Use distributed crawlers that run on multiple machines/servers to handle large-scale crawling.
A message queue system like RabbitMQ or Kafka can be used to distribute work between crawler instances.

10. Logging and Monitoring 📊:
- A logging system to track the number of URLs crawled, response times, errors, etc. Monitoring tools like Prometheus or Grafana for live metrics.

🔥 Bonus Points (Advanced Features):

1. Distributed Crawling 🖥️⚙️:
- Design a distributed system where multiple servers coordinate the crawling process to achieve higher throughput.

2. Politeness Policy 🛑:
- Implement mechanisms to detect the rate limits imposed by different websites and adjust the crawl rate dynamically to avoid getting blocked.

3. Search Engine Integration 🔍:
- The system could also interface with search engines and be used to build an index of crawled pages, similar to Google or Bing.

4. Machine Learning 🤖:
- Use machine learning to predict which links are most valuable or relevant to crawl next, optimizing the crawler’s efficiency.

🗨️ Possible Follow-Up Questions:

1. How would you design the system to avoid being blocked by websites (e.g., IP blocking or CAPTCHAs)?
2. What if a website dynamically generates links using JavaScript? How would you handle crawling such pages?
3. How would you handle different languages and encoding issues on websites?
