üïí Timeline and Structure:

1. Clarifications (5‚Äì7 minutes)
Goal: Set clear expectations and define the scope.
- Clarify requirements: 
- "What is the end goal?" ‚Äì Are we storing or processing data? Should we extract metadata or raw HTML?
- "What‚Äôs the scale?" ‚Äì How many pages do we need to crawl? How many URLs per day/hour?
- "What are the priorities?" ‚Äì Is scalability, performance, or cost most critical?
- "Is this real-time?" ‚Äì Do we need to refresh crawled data periodically?
- "Do we need to respect `robots.txt`?" ‚Äì Should we strictly follow the rules?

Example Questions:
- "Are we building this for a search engine, or simply storing the raw HTML data?"
- "What kind of failure tolerance should the system have?"
- "Is there any expectation to handle login-protected content?"

2. High-Level Architecture (8‚Äì10 minutes)
Goal: Present the big picture of the system, focusing on components and data flow.
- Describe the core components:
1. URL Frontier (Queue for managing URLs to crawl).
2. Crawler Manager (Assigns tasks to crawlers).
3. Parsers (Extracts data and links from web pages).
4. Data Storage (For metadata and content).
5. Scheduler & Throttler (For respecting robots.txt, limiting request rate).
6. Loop Detection & Deduplication (Avoid crawling the same URL).
- Draw a high-level diagram (verbally describe):
- How the URL frontier sends URLs to workers.
- Crawlers fetching content and parsing data.
- How data flows to storage and how loops are handled.

Key phrases:
- ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs the main architecture: we have a set of distributed crawlers managed by a central component, the URL frontier, which assigns URLs.‚Äù
- "Each crawler fetches the page content, parses it for links, and sends new links back to the frontier queue, while avoiding loops."

3. Diving into Specific Components (15‚Äì20 minutes)
Goal: Go deeper into each component and discuss implementation details. This shows your ability to reason through technical decisions.
- URL Frontier:
- What data structure to use? (Queue, priority queue, etc.)
- How to handle URL de-duplication? (HashSet, Bloom filters).
- Scalability: How will this queue grow as the number of URLs grows?

- Crawler Manager:
- How will we handle parallel crawlers? (Goroutines, threads, or distributed systems like Kafka).
- Fault tolerance: What happens if a crawler crashes?

- Parsers:
- Which libraries or tools to parse HTML (e.g., BeautifulSoup, regex)?
- How will we extract links, metadata, and other relevant content from a page?

- Data Storage:
- For the raw HTML or metadata, should we use NoSQL (e.g., MongoDB for flexibility) or SQL (for structured data)?
- Key-value stores like Redis for URL tracking and fast lookups.

- Throttling & Robots.txt:
- How do we respect website crawling limits (request frequency)?
- Implementing a politeness policy: only sending one request per domain per second.

- Retry Logic:
- How will we handle failed requests? Retries with exponential backoff? Circuit breakers?

Key phrases:
- ‚ÄúIn the URL Frontier, I‚Äôd store each URL and its depth to ensure we don‚Äôt crawl beyond the defined level. I‚Äôd also use a Bloom filter to quickly detect duplicates.‚Äù
- "For the Crawler Manager, I‚Äôll use a thread pool or worker-based system to parallelize crawling, enabling horizontal scalability."

4. Scalability & Distributed Crawling (8‚Äì10 minutes)
Goal: Focus on making the crawler scalable and fault-tolerant for large-scale use.
- Horizontal Scaling: How would you scale the crawler to handle millions of URLs? You can talk about distributed crawling with:
- Message queues (e.g., RabbitMQ or Kafka) to assign URLs across different machines.
- Load balancers for distributing URL processing across servers.
- Sharding by domain to make domain-based partitioning easier.

- Data Storage at Scale:
- Discuss how data storage systems like Hadoop or Amazon S3 can be used for storing large volumes of HTML content.
- Use distributed databases (like Cassandra) for metadata.

- Monitoring & Alerting:
- Introduce tools like Prometheus or Grafana for real-time metrics, showing the health of crawlers.
- Build alert systems for failure detection (crawlers getting stuck, memory leaks, etc.).

Key phrases:
- ‚ÄúFor scaling, I‚Äôd introduce distributed crawlers across machines with a message queue for assigning URLs to workers.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúTo handle high throughput, I‚Äôd also shard URLs by domain and ensure we respect rate limits per domain.‚Äù

5. Handling Edge Cases and Errors (8‚Äì10 minutes)
Goal: Show that you‚Äôve thought through potential problems and how to handle them.
- Error Handling:
- Discuss retries with backoff.
- Circuit breaking to stop retrying after a set threshold.

- Loop Detection:
- Explain how you'll implement logic to avoid visiting the same set of pages over and over.

- Handling CAPTCHAs and IP Blocking:
- Use techniques like rotating proxies or headless browser detection to handle advanced cases.

Key phrases:
- "For failed requests, I‚Äôd implement exponential backoff and a retry limit to prevent overwhelming the system."
- ‚ÄúTo avoid URL loops, I‚Äôd maintain a hash of visited URLs and use it for quick lookups before processing new URLs.‚Äù

6. Trade-offs and Optimizations (7‚Äì10 minutes)
Goal: Discuss trade-offs in your design decisions and show flexibility.
- Crawl Rate vs. Website Load:
- Trade-off between aggressive crawling and politeness to avoid overloading websites.

- Consistency vs. Availability:
- You might prioritize availability (crawling more pages) over consistency (processing data immediately).

- Storage Choices:
- Trade-off between SQL (structured) vs. NoSQL (flexible).

- Real-Time Processing vs. Batch Processing:
- Discuss whether processing the data in real-time or in batches makes more sense for your design.

Key phrases:
- ‚ÄúOne trade-off here is between aggressive crawling to cover more pages and being polite to websites. We can throttle requests but reduce our crawl rate.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúFor storage, using NoSQL gives us flexibility, but it comes at the cost of complex querying.‚Äù

üèÅ Conclusion (2‚Äì3 minutes)
Goal: Recap your design decisions and highlight any improvements or potential future enhancements.
- Briefly summarize the key components.
- Mention how the system is scalable, fault-tolerant, and avoids common pitfalls like loops or overloading websites.

Key phrases:
- ‚ÄúTo summarize, this design uses a distributed crawler system with a URL frontier, robust error handling, and a scalable architecture to crawl billions of web pages efficiently.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúFuture improvements could include adding machine learning to predict the most valuable URLs to crawl next, and improving fault tolerance through more sophisticated retry policies.‚Äù
