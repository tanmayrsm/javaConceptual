1. Clarifying Questions (5-10 minutes)
- Understand the Scope: Ask questions to clarify the extent of customization in scorecards. For example:
- Can sections/questions be reused across scorecards?
- How complex are the scoring rules (e.g., predefined weights, dynamic based on user input)?
- Any constraints around real-time updates and latency for certain actions?
- User Base: How large is the organization or group of users (employees, evaluators, admins)?
- Audit & Versioning: What depth of audit history is required? Can scorecards be reverted to previous versions?

2. Defining Functional Components (10 minutes)
- User Roles: Outline the three roles (Admin, Evaluator, User), their access levels, and typical workflows:
- Admin: Manage scorecards, assign evaluators, set permissions, view history.
- Evaluator: Fill out scorecards, submit them for finalization.
- User: View finalized scorecards.
- Scorecard Lifecycle: Highlight the states (Draft, Submitted, Finalized) and transition rules, including who can trigger state changes.
- Custom Scoring Rules: Briefly discuss weighted scores, types of questions (numeric, textual feedback), and how flexible or dynamic they need to be.
- Notifications: Define when notifications are triggered (e.g., when a scorecard is submitted or finalized).

3. High-Level Architecture (10-15 minutes)
- Microservices: Suggest a microservice architecture where:
- User Management Service: Handles roles, authentication (JWT or OAuth), and role-based access control (RBAC).
- Scorecard Service: Manages the lifecycle of scorecards (creation, update, submit, finalize).
- Section & Question Service: Manages sections, questions, and scoring logic.
- Audit & Versioning Service: Logs all changes to scorecards for future reference.
- API Gateway: Exposes REST APIs for interacting with the services.
- Database Layer: Use a relational database (like PostgreSQL) to store user info, scorecards, sections, questions, and scores.

4. Database Design (10-15 minutes)
- Entity Relationships:
- User Table: Stores user ID, name, email, and role.
- Scorecard Table: Stores scorecard ID, title, status (Draft, Submitted, Finalized), created_by (Admin), and assigned_evaluator.
- Section Table: Links sections to a scorecard.
- Question Table: Links questions to sections, including type (numeric, text).
- Score Table: Stores responses to questions by evaluators (numeric score or textual feedback).
- Audit Log Table: Tracks actions (create, update, finalize), timestamp, and the user performing the action.
- Indexes: Suggest indexing scorecard status, user ID, and date fields to optimize query performance.

5. System Scale and Non-Functional Requirements (10-12 minutes)
- Scalability: Suggest using load balancers and database replication to support high traffic. Discuss strategies like sharding based on user or organization ID if needed.
- Availability: Propose cloud-based solutions (AWS, GCP) with auto-scaling, multi-region deployment, and 99.9% uptime SLA.
- Low Latency: Ensure quick access by using caching mechanisms (e.g., Redis) for frequently accessed data like scorecard templates or past versions.
- Security: Implement encryption at rest and in transit, access control at service levels, and ensure compliance with data protection standards (e.g., GDPR).

6. APIs and Sample Queries (5-8 minutes)
- User Management:
- `POST /login`: For user authentication.
- `POST /users`: To create new users with roles.
- Scorecard Management:
- `POST /scorecards`: To create a new scorecard.
- `PATCH /scorecards/:id`: To update a scorecard.
- `POST /scorecards/:id/submit`: To submit a scorecard for review.
- `POST /scorecards/:id/finalize`: To finalize a scorecard.
- Reports:
- `GET /reports`: Filter scorecards by evaluator, date range, or status.
- SQL Queries:
1. Retrieve Scorecards for an Evaluator:
```sql
SELECT * FROM scorecards WHERE evaluator_id = ? AND created_at BETWEEN ? AND ?;
```
2. Fetch Sections and Questions for a Scorecard:
```sql
SELECT sections.title, questions.text
FROM sections
JOIN questions ON sections.id = questions.section_id
WHERE scorecard_id = ?;
```
3. Generate Report on Score Distribution:
```sql
SELECT user_id, AVG(score) AS average_score
FROM scores
WHERE scorecard_id IN (SELECT id FROM scorecards WHERE created_at BETWEEN ? AND ?)
GROUP BY user_id;
```

7. Final Thoughts and Trade-offs (3-5 minutes)
- Discuss trade-offs, such as prioritizing features vs. performance (e.g., audit logging could add overhead).
- Mention potential future enhancements like AI-based scorecard analysis or dynamic question generation based on previous answers.
