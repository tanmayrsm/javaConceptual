| evaluator_id | INTEGER    | Foreign key referencing `users(id)` (Evaluator providing the score) |
| scorecard_id | INTEGER    | Foreign key referencing `scorecards(id)` (The scorecard being filled out) |
| response     | TEXT or INTEGER | Response provided (numeric score or text feedback) |
| created_at   | TIMESTAMP  | Timestamp when the score was given |
| updated_at   | TIMESTAMP  | Timestamp for the last update |

---

6. audit_logs

| id           | SERIAL     | Primary key (Unique identifier for each notification) |
| user_id      | INTEGER    | Foreign key referencing `users(id)` (User receiving the notification) |
| message      | TEXT       | The notification message (e.g., "Your scorecard has been finalized.") |
| read         | BOOLEAN    | Status of the notification (whether it has been read) |
| created_at   | TIMESTAMP  | Timestamp when the notification was created |

---

Relationships:
1. One-to-Many between `users` (Admin) and `scorecards` (An Admin creates multiple scorecards).
2. One-to-Many between `scorecards` and `sections` (A scorecard contains multiple sections).
3. One-to-Many between `sections` and `questions` (A section contains multiple questions).
4. One-to-Many between `questions` and `scores` (Each question can have multiple scores for different users).
5. One-to-Many between `scorecards` and `scores` (Each scorecard contains multiple scores).
6. One-to-Many between `users` (Evaluator) and `scores` (An evaluator provides multiple scores).
7. One-to-Many between `scorecards` and `audit_logs` (A scorecard can have multiple audit log entries).
8. One-to-Many between `users` and `notifications` (Each user can receive multiple notifications).
