Relationships between Entities
- Users ↔ Color Lists: A user can have many color lists (`one-to-many`).
- Color Lists ↔ Shared Access: A color list can be shared with many users with specific permissions (`many-to-many`).
- Color Lists ↔ Audit Logs: Every action (add, delete, share) is logged (`one-to-many`).
- Color Lists ↔ Email Shares: A color list can be shared via email to many non-registered users (`one-to-many`).
- Colors ↔ Color Lists: Multiple color lists can contain the same color (`many-to-many` via the `colors` JSONB field or a relational `ColorLists_Colors` table if necessary).

This schema allows for efficient management of color lists, user sharing, and access control, while also logging actions and handling non-registered users via email shares.
